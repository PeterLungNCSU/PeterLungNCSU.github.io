title: NHL Data Pull and Analysis
---

I had a good time and learned a lot while doing the hockey analysis I have been working on for ST 558. This was my first time working with an API and although I'm a sports fan, I've never been much into hockey, so I was able to learn a little about the sport. I'm a huge data junkie so it was fun diving into the data once I got the chance. I ended up doing a couple of "extra" things that weren't required by the project just because I was having fun doing analysis.

The project had two major components. The first was to create functions that can communicate with the NHL API and pull the tables that are called. This part also required that there be a wrapper function that can grab any one of those tables from a single function call. This part was educational for learning how to use an API and troubleshoot any problems that arise.

The second part was a data analysis portion, where I had to create tables and graphs and show interesting output. I found two very fun things:
* First, that a team's regular season record is not as indicative of playoff success as one might think.
* Second, that a goalie's worst game is correlated with career win percentage.

This data was super fun to work with, but the process wasn't without some difficulties. First, this was a very time consuming project. I spent a lot of hours on it. It took a while for me to figure out how to create a .md document, writing the functions wasn't hard, but it took a while, and creating graphs includes a lot of trial and error to get the look I want.

If I were to do this project over, I would make sure I am coding everything neatly (I get sloppy when I'm just trying to figure out how to get something to run) the first time through instead of changing everything at the end. Hopefully you enjoy my analysis as much as I enjoyed doing it!
