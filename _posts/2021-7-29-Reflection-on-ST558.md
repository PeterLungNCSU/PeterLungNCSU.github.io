title: Thoughts on ST558
---

Looking back on the semester, I am surprised by how much work the class was. I knew graduate school would be hard work and I knew it would be difficult at times, but with my coding background I expected to have an easier time learning R and doing the work. In short, this was supposed to be my easy class this semester. Well, as it turned out, the class was no cake walk. I found myself putting many extra hours in when I thought I could breeze through assignments. I struggled through the first exam and had to put in extra study time to make sure I did well on the second. This class made me earn my grade!

One of the main themes in the class is learning what a data scientist does (it is called *Data Science for Statisticians* for a reason I guess). I would say that I am not at all surprised by what I found. In my first blog post, I discussed what I think data science is, and as someone who has been working with data scientists and doing data science for over a decade, I kind of already knew what I was talking about. Data scientists are a cross between software developers and statisticians. They primarily use SAS, R, Python, SQL, and some other programming languages to build software tools that utilize statistical methods to help business. I think that the content of the course was perfectly geared towards prepping students to work in data science (particularly if they will use R heavily).

Where I think I learned a lot is in the utility and functionality of R. I have used SAS and Python previously and took this class so that I could pick up R since several of my coworkers are always talking it up. I had *heard* terms like "Shiny" and "Markdown" but hadn't used these apps and didn't really know what they could do. Now I am an R junkie. I am starting to find ways to utilize it in my work. I am using caret to tune hyper-parameters for a boosted tree model we are using! (The code is actually running as I write this). So I will obviously be using R more in the future. The biggest reason is that it has a lot more selection for statistical computation than Python (and a lot more of it has been verified). Python definitely has it's good points, and the majority of my team's work is in Python, so I am about to start a side project for the team where I will be looking into integrating the two languages. I want to be able to wrap a program in Python, but call R to generate statistical output.

Finally, there is the question of what I will do differently in my post-558 world. Aside from using R more often for statistical output, I am considering moving my work presentations from PowerPoint into Markdown. It looks more professional (PowerPoint can look cartooney sometimes) and it easily embeds R code. I also like the plots and table output from R, so I can use that instead of copying and pasting stuff from Excel.

While the class was tough, I definitely learned a lot and I definitely see a lot of application for the things I learned. There is a lot of content, but there really isn't much that I would change from the course - especially from what is covered.
