title: What is Data Science?
---

Data Science is a broad area that encompasses many fields, requires various skills and is not defined by one academic discipline. A data scientist requires skills in statistical analysis, statistical programming, software engineering and creative thinking. Data scientists are usually employed by business that are interested in using data to boost revenue or cut costs. The problems that businesses want to solve involve things such as forecasting, causal analysis, one-step-ahead prediction, A/B testing, optimization and other things that typically require heavy lifting from mathematical modeling. 

Once the solution has been designed and the models fit, that process must be implemented into the business process. How companies have preferred to do this recently has been to build large-scale software programs with a user interface for the non-technical user of the product. These programs are often novel, take years to develop, cost milions of dollars and need constant updating as business processes change how the output is used.

In order to do the work described above, data scientists must have a strong background in Statistics, Mathematics and Programming.

Statistics is crucial because the data scientist must be able to utilize statistical analysis to describe what is going on with the data, discover relationships between variables in the data and make inferences about the business problem while stating the degree of uncertainty associated with the resulting estimates. Often the business problem requires a solution that is not appropriately solved by an "out-of-the-box" statistical procedure, so it is useful for data scientists to be well-versed in statistical modeling such that they can create customized solutions to business problems. It is here that mathematics can be helpful for modeling the business problem prior to using statistical analysis to estimate and make inferences.

Finally, a data scientist spends most of his or her time programming. Building programs, particularly with Python and R, is the hallmark of data science. The problems are based on mathematical solutions and they use data, but the heavy lifting is the programming. Data scientists should know how to run code, proper programming practices and should know how to program any solution (or how to find out how to program something they don't already know).

A data scientist in one way or another is a statistician. They use statistical analysis to find solutions to problems, which is basically what a statistician does. They program in R, Python, SAS and other languages, but so do statisticians. They develop new solutions to problems just like statistics professors do. I think that the major distinction is that data scientists develop customized solutions to a single business problem that will likely have few if any use cases outside of their specific project while statisticians develop new mathematical procedures that can be generalized to a class of problems. Even then, the difference is hazy.

I see myself as a statistician who has mainly worked in data science. When I meet somebody and they ask me what I do, I tell them I am a statistician. Most of my job involves brainstorming new statistical ideas and coding them to be tested, then implementing the best solution. Many of the people I work with have advanced degrees in statistics, and it is difficult for them to articulate how what they do is different than what they would do if their job title was "statistician".
