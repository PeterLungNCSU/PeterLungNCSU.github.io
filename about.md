![](/images/Me_Kids.JPG)

I am 36 years old, I have worked in statistical and econometric modeling for 11 years and I currently work for the **Walt Disney Company**. I have four awesome kids and a beautiful wife who I love. I am a statistics student at NC State University living in Raleigh, NC.

### More Information

I am primarily interested in **time series statistics** and **longitudinal data analysis**. Most of my work has concerned linear econometric models of one kind or another and I have primarily programmed in **SAS** and **Python**, so I am new to R.
